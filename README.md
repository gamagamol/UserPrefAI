Upon successful login, the preferences will be initialized with default values from the backend. You can modify these defaults, such as:
1.Toggling the dark mode
2.Enabling or disabling notifications
3.Changing the language
4.When dark mode is activated, the general color scheme will switch to darker tones. Conversely, when dark mode is turned off, the color scheme will return to a lighter, white background.
5.When notifications are disabled, the notification icon will be updated to reflect this change.
6.Additionally, when you change the language, the labels and text within the interface will update accordingly. This application currently supports three languages: Indonesian, Japanese, and English.
